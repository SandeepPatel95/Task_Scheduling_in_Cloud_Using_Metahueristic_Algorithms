# Task_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Using_Metahueristic_Algorithms:
</br> Metaheuristics provide approximate solutions to optimization problems through iterative improvement. Some commonly used algorithms include:
 # Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
###### 1. Principle: </br>
Inspired by the social behavior of birds or fish, where particles adjust their positions based on personal and group experiences.
###### 2.Advantages: </br>
Good balance between exploration and exploitation.
###### 3.Application:</br> 
Suitable for continuous optimization and scheduling with minimal parameter tuning.

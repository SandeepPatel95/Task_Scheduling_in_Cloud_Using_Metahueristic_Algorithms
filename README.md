# Task_Scheduling_in_Cloud_Using_Metahueristic_Algorithms
Metaheuristics provide approximate solutions to optimization problems through iterative improvement. Some commonly used algorithms include:
 Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
Principle: Inspired by the social behavior of birds or fish, where particles adjust their positions based on personal and group experiences.
Advantages: Good balance between exploration and exploitation.
Application: Suitable for continuous optimization and scheduling with minimal parameter tuning.
